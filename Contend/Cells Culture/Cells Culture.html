                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cell culture is a process of growing cells outside their natural environment, like growing human cells outside a human body. For this, it </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">is needed</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to isolate the human cells of a specific tissue, nurture them, and control their environment and conditions. Those factors help the cells grow and, therefore, accelerate their development.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: center; max-height=800; max-width=1600; min-height=400; min-width=800;"><img src="/Contend/Cells Culture/Images/01.png" alt=""></p>
                <p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some essential conditions that cells of cell culture </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">are subjected</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to are:</span></strong></span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Controlled Environment:</span></strong></span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> The incubator's temperature, what kind of incubator it is, whether it uses CO2 (which is </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">not necessary</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to grow it), and even humidity.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: center; max-height=400; max-width=800; min-height=200; min-width=800;"><img src="/Contend/Cells Culture/Images/02.png" alt=""></p>
                <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nurture: </span></strong></span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cells need to grow, so they must consume some 'food.' That means they need to </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">be nurtured</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. A different medium is necessary for each cell, such as Fetal bovine serum (FBS), a centrifuged and filtered liquid extracted from fetal bovine blood.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: center; max-height=800; max-width=1600; min-height=400; min-width=800;"><img src="/Contend/Cells Culture/Images/03.png" alt=""></p>
                <p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Aseptic Techniques:</span></strong></span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cultivating</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the cells in a clean and aseptic place </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">is vital</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. This differs from growing bacteria or fungi because they need less protection and are less delicate. Antibiotics and antifungals </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">must be administered</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, such as ampicillin, streptomycin, or gentamicin.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">The cells must also be filtered</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> often, and </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">their flasks must be changed</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: center; max-height=800; max-width=1600; min-height=400; min-width=800;"><img src="/Contend/Cells Culture/Images/04.png" alt=""></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To culture cells, you need to consider the cell types. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> includes primary cells, which are isolated from tissue; immortalized cell lines, which are immortalized cells that can divide indefinitely, such as HEK293; and stem cell lines, which are cells that can self-renew or turn into distinct cell types due to the signals they receive from the body.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: center; max-height=800; max-width=1600; min-height=400; min-width=800;"><a style="right-margin=100px"><img src="/Contend/Cells Culture/Images/05.png" alt=""></a><img src="/Contend/Cells Culture/Images/07.png" alt=""></p>
                <p style="text-align: center; max-height=800; max-width=1600; min-height=400; min-width=800;"><img src="/Contend/Cells Culture/Images/06.png" alt=""></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cell culture can help people in biological research. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> is because it can help people study the behavior of the cell, drug discovery and development (using the cells as a test for drugs or for developing some treatment), vaccine production, tissue engineering (creation of artificial tissue, for example, artificial organs), and genetic engineering (to study the function of the gene or do gene therapy).</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, regarding the uses of cell culture, which </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">were previously cited</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, they have </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">not developed</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the complexity of a living organism.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> That is why exit tests are done in vitro and in vivo. The reliability can </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">be decreased</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> over time due to the mutations the cultured cell line can suffer, thus changing their behavior. They are delicate, so bacteria and fungi can easily contaminate your culture and compromise the goal of the culture. It is expensive and difficult to administer as a large-scale production. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> is one of the reasons for the difficulty of producing large-scale meat using cell culture.</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cell culture has a lot to evolve and help different societies. One of the evolutions into the cell culture field is 3D cell culture, which can reduce the lack of complexity of the cells and structure problems. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> can make the cells grow together in all directions into the media. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> differs from the current 2D cell culture, which only grows on the bottom of the flasks. Organ-on-a-chip, which simulates human organs to test drugs and disease modeling. Additionally, stem cell-based therapies aim to regenerate damaged tissue and organs.</span></p>
